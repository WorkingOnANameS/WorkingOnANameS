- 👋 Hi, I am WOANS.
 <!--- - 👀 I’m interested in ... --->
- 📖 I am always learning.
    - I am also looking for guidance; that is:
    - I feel compelled to, eventually, teach others, and something is very wrong if _I_ am feeling this. 
<!--- - 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... --->
<!--- - 📫 How to reach me ... --->
<!--- - 😄 Pronouns: ... --->
- ⚡ Fun fact: To be here, the "top" of humanity, we have locked so many others out.
    - ☁️ Question: is this our greatest success in attempting parity or is this our worse failure of acknowledging the inevitable?
<!--- - Perhaps a weak line of thought that is untested by others in my solitude, but I find it is a thought that goes unexpressed and unasked often enough.
<!--- - I often leave rather cryptic messages and strings on the web as I reflect (for fun), but that (cryptic nature) is just an inherent quality of most solitary thought. A coherent idea depends on information often forgotten in what we outwardly project (unless this is a practiced or natural skill). That is to ask: I have spent life here on the Internet; a sloppy individual becoming neat in solitary. I am mostly solitary thoughts, organized for no one other than me. Does anyone know who I really am? Can anyone know who I really am?
<!--- I like doing this because I find arbitary writing constraints (about me character limits, writing as if this were a hidden comment to be found, e.t.c) are simply a different environment to think in than in true solitude.
